## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.

## Detach elements when working with them
### Why?
Because updating the DOM is heavy on the client elements should be .detach() -ed when updating multiple things.

### How?
``` javascript
var todoItems = $('.todo-items');
var parent = todoItems.parent();

todoItems.detach(); 
// ... add/remove classes, attributes and/or content
 
parent.append(todoItems);
```
