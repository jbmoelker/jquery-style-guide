## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.


## Consider lightweight alternative

jQuery is the swiss army knive for DOM and event handling and much more. While jQuery offers a wide range of features, you might not need most of them in your project. Simply because you have little functionality or only modern browsers to support. In that case consider a lightweight alternative.

### Why?

* Lightweight alternatives have a smaller file size and can therefore be downloaded faster.
* Lightweight alternatives have less wrapper functionality which typically makes them faster.
* Some lightweight alternatives support only newer browsers and can therefore stay closer to native browser methods. This typically makes them more performant and easier to understand.
* Some lightweight alternatives mimic the jQuery API. Which means if you know jQuery, you know the alternative.

### How?

* Use a lightweight alternative like [Dominus](https://github.com/bevacqua/dominus#readme), [Shoestring](https://github.com/filamentgroup/shoestring#readme) or [Zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto#readme).
* [Create a jQuery custom build](#create-a-custom-build) to only include the features you need.
